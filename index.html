      Reason: Minecraft, my other slightly comfort game. I don't really play this one on my own either. I love building bases with friends and playing mini games (even though I'm really bad at them). However, I haven't played much since I get pretty motion sick from the game and after a while, the game gets a bit boring. The game is still ever-changing with each new update, so I look forward to those.</p>

      Reason: I only play The Sims when I have time to. This includes time that I don't have academic work or when none of my friends are online to play. I don't remember how much I've spent on expansion packs and dlcs for this game, but it's been quite a few. I first got this game for my love of interior design. When I got this game, I was so sure that I was going to go to Ryerson for Interior Design, but I ended up going elsewhere. Nonetheless, it's always fun to customize my OCs from books I write into The Sims. I am able to build and better visualize how my imaginary world and characters would look.</p>
